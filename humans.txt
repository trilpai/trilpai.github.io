/* PHILOSOPHY */
Clarity before speed.
Systems before shortcuts.
Quality before urgency.
AI accelerates engineering — it does not replace thinking.

/* FRAMEWORK */
3 Octaves — A maturity model for software engineering.

Octave 1: Signal Formation  
Understanding problems clearly before building.

Octave 2: Signal Construction  
Building systems with discipline, verification, and intent.

Octave 3: Signal Propagation  
Operating, owning, and sustaining systems in production.

The same principles repeat at higher levels of responsibility:
clarity → construction → consequence.

/* ABOUT */
Trilp AI is a software engineering studio focused on building
production-grade systems using AI-accelerated engineering pipelines.

Work emphasizes:
– clear intent and specifications  
– strong architecture and boundaries  
– disciplined implementation  
– verification by default  
– reliable operations over time  

AI is used to amplify execution, not outsource responsibility.

/* PRINCIPLES */
Understanding is the first deliverable.
Constraints make solutions real.
Automation follows comprehension.
Production is the final authority.
Systems must outlive their creators.

/* TECHNOLOGY */
